## Credits

Because previous projects also used Inquirer.js, I referenced that code regularly for this project. As the project went on, that code was replaced with code better suited for this project. 

I used various learning resources like Stack Overflow and W3 schools to help with random questions I had.

I used the Inquirer.js documentation a lot for this project to help create my code. 

I used this generator to make the logo: https://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&h=0&v=0&f=Big%20Money-nw&t=Employee%0A%20Tracker
