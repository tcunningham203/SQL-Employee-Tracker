## Credits

Because previous projects also used Inquirer.js, I referenced that code regularly for this project. As the project went on, that code was replaced with code better suited for this project. 

I used various learning resources like Stack Overflow and W3 schools to help with random questions I had.

I used the Inquirer.js documentation a lot for this project to help create my code.
